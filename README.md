- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FlorAccastelli

  I am passionate about web development as a way to enhance creativity, experience and good practices.
  Challenges guide me, and I don't stop until I get what I want.

  I am a Linux user, because I believe in open source as a form of teamwork and collaboration.

  The technologies and frameworks with which I have experience are: JavaScript, git and its workflow (git flow).
  On the backend, I develop with data structures, PostgreSQL, Sequelize and Node.js.
  On the frontend, I develop with HTML, React, Redux, CSS and Tailwind.
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript, react and redux.
